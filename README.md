# ðŸ“ˆ Income Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict **per capita income** over time using historical data from Canada.

## ðŸ§  What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is one of the most basic and powerful tools in machine learning. It models the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line (y = mx + b) to the observed data.

In this project:
- **X-axis** = Year
- **Y-axis** = Per capita income (US$)
- The model learns the trend and can predict income for any year you input.
## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- File used: `canada_per_capita_income.csv`
- Columns:
  - `year`: Year of the data point
  - `per capita income (US$)`: The income for that year
## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

1. Open the notebook:  
   **`Income Prediction Using Linear Regression.ipynb`**
2. Run all cells in order
3. When prompted, enter the year you want to predict (e.g., `2025`)
4. The model will display:
   - The predicted income
   - A graph with the regression line
## ðŸ“¸ Example Output
```python
ðŸ“… Enter the year you want to predict income for: 2025
ðŸ’° Predicted income in 2025: $46,974.64
